# kickstarter-analysi
Performing data analysis of kickstarters to uncover the trend
In submitted Excell sheet there are 3 tabs: 
* Kickstarter with all the data
* Outcomes Based on Goals
* Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Outcome based on goals
The percentage of successful plays vs. failed plays declines for goals 0-20,000. It shows the trend that larger goal drives larger risk of failure and also the number of projects with impact the rate. As an example $30,000 – $34,999 interval, with the highest rate of success. That would be related to the fact that there were only 3 plays launched, and the weight of success and failure is very significant for each launch. Another example of number of projects weight is the highest rate of failures is observed for donation 45,000 – 50,000. There is only one project that failed.

## Outcome based on launch date
The most of successful plays were launched in May. It increases since April and declines towards September. The period between late April and early September, is the Summer period, with small variations between countries. Thus, the number of people attending to the events will be larger during that period and the difference between failed and successful plays will be the largest. As the summer period is going towards the end (September - October), both numbers successful and failed plays declines with higher rate of successful launches. The number of successful and failed launches is almost equal in December.
